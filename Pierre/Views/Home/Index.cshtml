  <p id="bug">*Near the end of the day I realized a pretty significant bug, which is that if you attempt to add two different items to an order and enter the same quantity for each, the program will crash. This is because the orders are currently being stored as a dictionary, with quantities being keys and item names being values. Because you can't have matching keys in a dictionary, the program crashes. I am planning to refactor the code to store the items in a list instead of a dictionary, but at time of submission this bug persists.*</p>
